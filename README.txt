A library for interacting with Time API (www.timeapi.org).

It is very windows specific for a number of reasons, therefore I 
don't feel terribly bad about including an entire VS2010 solution here.  

Also an example which clicks the middle of the screen at an entered time.  

This was a school project at Champlain College.

It provides almost no useful functionality whatsoever.
